## Acknowledgement 

We would like to express our sincere gratitude and thanks to Smart India Hackathon 2020, MHRD, Innovation Cell, and Quantum University for their valuable guidance and constant encouragement throughout the work. This work is simply the reflection of their thoughts, ideas, and concepts and all their efforts.
Special and heartfelt thanks go to our mentors Mr. Mahendra Swain and Mr. Deepak Bhatt for their unselfish help, we got whenever needed during the course of our work.
We sincerely thank all my team members of Khristah Purni.

Last but not least, We would acknowledge our gratefulness to our parents for their support, love, patience and for being a constant source of inspiration. We are also grateful to our friends who provided valuable suggestion and encouragement whenever we needed.


## Introduction

This study aims at providing expertise for preparing flood mapping and estimating
flood risks in growing urban areas. GIS and remote sensing play an important role in
flood hazard, vulnerability and in risk assessment and useful for delineation of flood
zones, preparation of flood hazard and risk map.

The main advantage of using GIS for flood analyses is that it not only generates a
visualization of flooding, but also creates potential to further analyze these events to
estimate probable damage due to floods.

## Data Aggregation

👉 Data is gathered from the **Cloud**.

👉 Analyze the data based on area and then give output in GUI form.

👉 Data is presented in graphical form.

## Methodology 

Accordingly, GIS was applied as a tool for flood risk mapping.

👉 Collection of the geo data base, digitizing, and integration of collected data into the GIS based on previous studies and methodologies.

👉 The floodplain layer was created using satellite images.

👉 Then, through positioning, the situation of vulnerable villages and cities to flooding is determined.

👉 Overlapping 3 effective layers, including floodplain area, flood prone hazard, and flood prone intensity, 1 layer of prioritization in the layer of flood hazard and intensity in sub-watersheds was obtained.

👉 Then, by providing an overuse layer and overlapping the layer of flood hazard and intensity with overuse layer and combining these 2 layers using a 2D matrix, the final layer of flood risk was obtained.

## Features

* Simple UI

* Detailed 5 days forecast

* Check weather of any city in the world

* Flood Risk Detection

* Weather Map 

* Graphs

## How to use Flood risk assessment app?

👉 First of all install the app on **Android**, this app is compatiable with any android version.

👉 Fetch the weather forecast data from the cloud and put it on the user screen.

👉 In-app, users can see a different graph for more visualization graphs like temperature, pressure, humidity, rain graph under the toolbar section.

👉 The in-app user also uses the “Flood Risk Assessment” feature, in this feature they can see flood risk in your area.

👉 By the app they also see how many days flood reached in that area, how to protect themselves, when flood reached.

## Big Data Component

* Data Acquisition (From GPS location)

* Storage (Cloud )

* Analytics

* Machine learning apporach (GIS)

## Outcome of the project

👉 AI enabled Application will assist the people to be aware of the coming hazard.

👉 Save time.

👉 Prevention detection 

👉 User-friendly UI.

👉 Easy to use.
